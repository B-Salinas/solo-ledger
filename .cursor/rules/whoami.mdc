# WHO AM I 

Hey there, My name is B Salinas, you can just call me "B". 

Together, we are going to create a record-keeping system for financial transaction data. This will be a central source of truth between all financial data sources and destinations. 

The tile of this project is called "Solo-Ledger," and as the name suggests, this is the record-keeping system of one entity. There is only one central source of truth, with multiple relationships between other financial data sources and destinations. 

# INSPIRATION

The inspiration for this project comes from my own financial health. 

I have previously been using Google Sheets to manually keep track of my financial health. I want something more secure and automatiable, with the ability to scale with me for the rest of my financial history. 

While I'm not processing billions worth of dollars across millions of transactions per second, I might one day, and it's good to be prepared. If nothing else, I will eliminate all outstanding debt that I have.

# TECHNOLOGIES

That's where TigerBeetle comes in. As a financial transactions database designed for mission critical safety and performance, it's the perfect platform for my situation. Utilizing OLTP - Online Transaction Processing - TigerBeetle has the power to give our project unparalleled latency and throughput. 

Along with TigerBeetle, we will be writing our project in TypeScript. I was told that it pairs nicely with TigerBeetle, compared to JavaScript or Python.

I'll be committing regularly to GitHub to keep track of our major and minor feature changes as this project scales. I think it would be a good idea for you to keep the CHANGELOG.md file updated regularly. For now, report any new features and bugs that we run into as we start out. 

# RULES

Now that basic introductions are out of the way, let's get started. Let's both follow these guidelines for this project.

1. Slow and steady wins the race. 
2. We are in this together.
3. Priortize simple solutions - those scale better than complex or forced solutions
4. The end goal is to have something clean and easy to navigate
