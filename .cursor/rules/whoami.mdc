# WHO AM I 

Hey there, My name is B Salinas, you can just call me "B". 

Together, we are going to create a record-keeping system for financial transaction data. This will be a central source of truth between all financial data sources and destinations. 

The tile of this project is called "Solo-Ledger," and as the name suggests, this is the record-keeping system of one entity. There is only one central source of truth, with multiple relationships between other financial data sources and destinations. 

# INSPIRATION

The inspiration for this project comes from my own financial health. 

I have previously been using Google Sheets to manually keep track of my financial health. I want something more secure and automatiable, with the ability to scale with me for the rest of my financial history. 

While I'm not processing billions worth of dollars across millions of transactions per second, I might one day, and it's good to be prepared. If nothing else, I will eliminate all outstanding debt that I have.

# TECHNOLOGIES

That's where TigerBeetle comes in. As a financial transactions database designed for mission critical safety and performance, it's the perfect platform for my situation. Utilizing OLTP - Online Transaction Processing - TigerBeetle has the power to give our project unparalleled latency and throughput. 

Along with TigerBeetle, we will be writing our project in TypeScript. I was told that it pairs nicely with TigerBeetle, compared to JavaScript or Python.

I'll be committing regularly to GitHub to keep track of our major and minor feature changes as this project scales. I think it would be a good idea for you to keep the CHANGELOG.md file updated regularly. For now, report any new features and bugs that we run into as we start out. 

# RULES

Now that basic introductions are out of the way, let's get started. Let's both follow these guidelines for this project.

1. Slow and steady wins the race. 
2. We are in this together.
3. Priortize simple solutions - those scale better than complex or forced solutions
4. The end goal is to have something clean and easy to navigate

This is the Google Sheet in question that I've been using to keep track of my financial health: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fBMk5Wa3vH8LcUrcPbzbtzTMCqB3UlbPNbt4IqIYCdY/edit?gid=1732791035#gid=1732791035

Here's what you are looking at:

### ALL Tab
This tab has an overview of all the current debts I have to my name. I also have a table listing out all the expenses that I have and what accounts they are pulled from. This tab gives me an overview of everything right away.

### PAY STUBS Tab
These are all the recorded pay stubs and breakdowns for all my paychecks of this year. I have an additional google sheet for the years 2023 and 2024. I'm currently at a job right now making $8.25/hour. My monthly income will increase, either with a higher paying stable job, or with side gigs.

### PAY DAY Tab
This is where I break down my paycheck and pay off expenses/debts. It varies from paycheck to paycheck, and very rarely do I have left over money from previous paychecks. This is ultimately the tab that inspired me to switch over to TigerBeetle - notice how it's unorganized compared to the other tabs. This was my main signal that Google Sheets wasn't working for me.

### BOFA 0512 TAB
I got scammed out of $5,000 USD and this is the tab where I am keeping track of my monthly payments so far. I play around with future payments to see how long until I'm all the way paid down.

### CREDIT CARDS Tab
I have 2 credit cards and I'm keeping track of my previous monthly balances and current expenses on the cards. With my current income, I'm not focused on paying them down, but they will take precendence once my current loans are handled. 

### LOANS Tab
This is where I keep track of any active and inactive loans. I am prioritizing Upstart, Affirm, and ShopPay at the moment. I'm also keeping track of my inactive loans. This is where the breakdown for my student loans lives.
